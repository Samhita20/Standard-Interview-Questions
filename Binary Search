Binary Search

Given a sorted array of size N and an integer K, find the position at which K is present in the array using binary search.

def binarysearch(self, arr, n, k):
		# code here
		l = 0
		r = n-1
		while l <= r: 
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2; 
            if arr[mid] == k: 
                return mid 
            elif arr[mid] < k: 
                l = mid + 1
            else: 
                r = mid - 1
        return -1
