Equilibrium Point

Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

def equilibriumPoint(a, n):
    # Your code here
    if(n==1):
      return 1  
    left=0
    right=sum(a)
    for i, j in enumerate(a): 
        right = right - a[i]
        if(left==right):
            return i+1
        left = left + j
    return -1
